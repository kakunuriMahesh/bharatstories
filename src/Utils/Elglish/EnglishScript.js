Jarasandha attacked Mathura 17 times with vast armies, seeking revenge for Kamsa’s death. Though Krishna and Balarama valiantly defended the city each time, the constant warfare left the citizens weary and vulnerable.

Understanding the plight of the people, Krishna decided to relocate them to a safer place. He chose the western coast of India near the Arabian Sea. With his divine powers, Krishna called upon Vishwakarma, the celestial architect, to build an invincible city on an island. The result was Dwaraka, a fortified city surrounded by the ocean, equipped with majestic palaces, gardens, and gateways that shone like gold.

Krishna then used his mystical powers to transport all the citizens of Mathura overnight to their new home in Dwaraka. This migration ensured their safety and marked the establishment of a prosperous and peaceful kingdom. Dwaraka became a hub of dharma, culture, and trade, earning it the title "Golden City."`,

                text: `Rukmini, the princess of Vidarbha, was renowned for her beauty, wisdom, and devotion to Krishna. Though her heart was set on marrying Krishna, her brother Rukmi opposed the union and arranged her marriage to Shishupala, a tyrannical king and Krishna’s sworn enemy.

Desperate, Rukmini sent a secret message to Krishna, pleading with him to rescue her. The message also included detailed plans for the elopement. On the day of her marriage, Krishna arrived in Vidarbha on his chariot, accompanied by Balarama and a small army.

As Rukmini stepped out of the temple after performing her bridal rituals, Krishna seized the moment. In a dramatic and bold move, he whisked her away in his chariot. Rukmi, furious at this defiance, pursued Krishna, but he was swiftly defeated. Though Krishna spared Rukmi’s life at Rukmini’s request, he humiliated him by shaving half of his head.

This event not only symbolized the triumph of love but also Krishna’s ability to stand up for dharma against unjust forces. The divine union of Krishna and Rukmini became a cornerstone in the spiritual and cultural narrative of Krishna’s life.`,

Krishna set out with his wife Satyabhama, who accompanied him as his equal in this mission. They faced numerous challenges, including defeating powerful allies of Narakasura and breaking through the impregnable defenses of his city.

The final battle saw Narakasura meeting his end at the hands of Satyabhama. Empowered by Krishna, she struck the fatal blow, fulfilling a divine prophecy that Narakasura would be killed by a woman. After the demon’s death, Krishna freed the abducted women and ensured their dignity by marrying them.

Duryodhana’s arrogance, however, knew no bounds. He not only rejected the proposal but also plotted to imprison Krishna. In response, Krishna revealed his Vishwaroopa, the cosmic form, demonstrating his divine nature to the Kauravas. Even then, Duryodhana and his allies remained unrepentant.

                దేవకి మరియు వసుదేవుడు కరుణ కోరారు, కానీ కంసుడు వినలేదు. అతను శిశువును పైకి ఎత్తి, నేలపై పడేయాలనుకున్నాడు.

                అకస్మాత్తుగా, శిశువు అతని చేతుల నుండి జారిపోయి ఆకాశంలోకి ఎగిరింది. ఆమె దేవి మహామాయగా మారింది, మరియు "ఓ కంసా, నిన్ను నాశనం చేయబోయే వాడు సురక్షితంగా ఉన్నాడు!" అని ప్రకటించింది.

                కంసుడు నిశ్చలంగా నిలబడ్డాడు, అతని అహంకారం నాశనమైంది. దివ్య ఆట ప్రారంభమైంది, మరియు అతని అంతం అనివార్యమైంది.`,
