                Gently, he placed his son beside her and took her daughter in his arms. “Forgive me,” he murmured, “for separating you from your parents. You are part of a divine plan beyond our understanding.” 

                Steeling his heart, Vasudev returned to Mathura with Nanda’s daughter. The exchange was complete, and the stage was set for destiny to unfold.`,

                Devaki and Vasudev begged for mercy, but their words fell on deaf ears. Laughing maniacally, Kamsa swung the infant above his head, ready to dash her to the ground.

                Suddenly, the child slipped from his grasp and soared into the sky. She transformed into Goddess Mahamaya, who declared, “O Kamsa, the one who will destroy you is safe and beyond your reach!”

                Kamsa stood frozen, his arrogance shattered. The divine game had begun, and his end was inevitable.`,
