This curse symbolized the cyclical nature of life, where even those who uphold dharma are not exempt from karma.

Krishna, witnessing the chaos, remained calm, knowing this was the destined end of his people. The destruction of the Yadava clan marked the closure of an era, illustrating the transient nature of power and the inevitability of cosmic justice.
